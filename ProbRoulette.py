"""Dice may not have any memory, but apparently the roulette wheel at the Learn Challenge Casino does. Youâ€™ve received a tip-off that the wheel has some exploitable bias where the probability of landing on a given number changes depending on the number previously landed on. Analyze a list containing a history of roulette spins.
Return a dictionary where the keys are numbers on the roulette wheel, and the values are dictionaries mapping numbers on the wheel to probabilities, such that `d[n1][n2]` is an estimate of the probability that the next spin will land on n2, given that the previous spin landed on n1.
